# 📊 Excel Analytics Platform

A full-stack web application that allows users to upload Excel files, analyze their contents, and store them securely — all with a login-protected dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Excel Analytics is a productivity tool built using **React (Vite)**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, designed to parse Excel files and extract meaningful insights. Users can register, upload their Excel data, and visualize or manage the uploaded content.

This project was born out of curiosity, learning, and countless hours of trial-and-error. As a solo developer, I faced real struggles understanding full-stack workflows — from authentication to Excel parsing, state management, and backend integration.

So if you’re a developer, learner, or contributor — **you’re warmly invited to join this journey** 💙
